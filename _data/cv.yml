    - name: Summary
      value: "My path to research has been, like my life, anything but conventional, beginning in Thailand, moving through Germany, and now continuing in Denmark. This international journey has fostered cultural openness and taught me to see the world from multiple perspectives. This adaptability is reflected in my career, from serving in the military to building startups, where I've seen systems both as they are run and as they are born. These experiences revealed that my true passion lies not just in building, but in the deeper question: how do machines actually learn? This question now drives my work in computer vision and pulls my intellectual curiosity toward the foundational puzzle of intelligence. I believe the next breakthroughs will emerge from a deeper understanding of learning itself. I am dedicated to exploring the internal world of models, investigating the first principles of reasoning in LLMs, and grappling with what makes an AI truly trustworthy."
