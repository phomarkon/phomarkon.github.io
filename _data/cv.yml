    - name: Summary
      value: My path to research has been, like my life, anything but conventional. It began in Thailand, moved through a youth in Germany, and now continues in Denmark, a journey that has taught me to see the world from multiple perspectives. I've served in the military and built startups from scratch; I've seen how systems are run and how they are born. These experiences were invaluable, but they ultimately revealed that my true passion wasn't just in building things, but in a deeper question: how do things learn? This is the question that now drives me. My current work in computer vision is my practical anchor in machine learning, but my intellectual curiosity pulls me toward the foundational puzzle of intelligence. I hold a growing conviction that the path toward more general and robust intelligence lies not in the brute force of bigger models and more data, but in discovering better, more fundamental principles. I believe the next breakthroughs will emerge from a deeper understanding of learning and reasoning itself. This is why I am less captivated by what a model can be engineered to do, and far more by what it might be guided to genuinely understand. This is the "great puzzle" I want to dedicate my PhD adventure to, to explore the internal world of models, to investigate the first principles of reasoning in LLMs, and to grapple with what makes an AI truly trustworthy. My journey has given me a unique perspective, and I am convinced the future of AI will not just be built on scale, but discovered through insight.
