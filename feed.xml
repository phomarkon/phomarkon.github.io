You might notice this is the only post here. While I would love to blog more, I‚Äôm a firm believer that you can do anything, but not everything. For that reason, I‚Äôve decided to put my main focus on my research activities for now.</p> <p>Below a text from my intro:</p> <blockquote> <p>My path to research has been anything but direct. I moved from Thailand to Germany as a kid, spent four years in the German Navy, and later co-founded two startups after coming to Denmark. What those experiences taught me is that my real drive isn‚Äôt building a business, but understanding how things learn and think. The questions that matter to me are academic ones.</p> <p>So now, I‚Äôm a software engineering undergraduate at the University of Southern Denmark, working as a research assistant with Associate Professor Serkan Ayvaz, who thankfully gives me the freedom to chase these ideas.</p> <p>I‚Äôm trying to absorb as much as I can across the field before a PhD. I‚Äôm interested in almost everything, but I can feel a definite pull. I‚Äôm drifting away from straightforward computer vision and more towards the cognitive and philosophical foundations of our work. My interest in psychology and neuroscience keeps leading me back to questions of thinking, reasoning, and what it even means for a model to be trustworthy.</p> <p>The idea that really grips me is the internal life of these models. The concept of ‚Äòmodel dreaming‚Äô‚Äîof a model learning from its own internally generated reality‚Äîfeels important. I suspect the next breakthroughs won‚Äôt just come from more data or bigger models, but from getting closer to these foundational principles of cognition. That‚Äôs the territory I want to spend my career exploring, starting with a PhD.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="so-what-is-this-site-far-future">So, What Is This Site (Far Future)?</h3> <p>This blog will be a reflection of that journey. It will likely be a mix of half-formed ideas, notes on papers that I find compelling, updates on my own research, and explorations into the cognitive side of AI. I find it helpful to write things down to clarify my own thinking.</p> <p>If you‚Äôre also wrestling with these kinds of ideas or just find them interesting, I‚Äôd be happy to connect.</p> <ul> <li>üìß Email: <a href="mailto:phongsakon@outlook.dk">phongsakon@outlook.dk</a></li> <li>üíº LinkedIn: <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/phongsakonmarkkonrad">linkedin.com/in/phongsakonmarkkonrad</a></li> </ul> <p>This site is, and will likely always be, a work in progress‚Äîmuch like my own understanding. Thanks for stopping by.</p> <hr/> <p><em>P.S. - You might see ‚Äúearly sleeper‚Äù listed as a skill of mine. I‚Äôm only half-joking. The kinds of problems I want to work on require a well-rested brain.</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal"/><category term="welcome"/><category term="introduction"/><category term="personal"/><category term="research"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few words on what this place is for.]]></summary></entry></feed>
