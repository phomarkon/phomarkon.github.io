Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Phongsakon Mark Konrad, and I'm excited to share this space with you.

## Who Am I?

Nothing very special here, just a normal guy who likes deep learning. Currently, I'm working as a Research Assistant at Syddansk Universitet (University of Southern Denmark), where I get to dive deep into machine learning research projects in the data and intelligence lab. It's fascinating work that sits at the intersection of academia and real-world applications.

## What You'll Find Here

This website is my digital home where I'll be sharing:

- **Research Journey**: Updates on my machine learning projects and academic endeavors
- **Technical Insights**: What I'm learning about AI, algorithms, and software development
- **Personal Reflections**: Thoughts on the intersection of research and entrepreneurship
- **Project Updates**: As I work on various ML and software projects

## A Bit About My Background

I've had quite a journey getting here! From my time in the Bundeswehr (where I learned discipline and leadership) to co-founding a startup focused on powerlifting apps, to now pursuing research in machine learning. Each experience has shaped my perspective on technology and its potential to solve real problems.

Currently, I'm also volunteering as an AI Engineer at a stealth startup, working on recommendation systems for mobile auction platforms. It's exciting to see how academic research and industry applications can complement each other.

## What's Next?

I'm passionate about:
- Building machine learning pipelines that actually work
- Writing research papers that contribute to the field
- Exploring the fascinating similarities between research and startup environments
- Bridging the gap between academia and entrepreneurship

## Let's Connect!

I believe in the power of community and collaboration. Whether you're a fellow researcher, a tech enthusiast, or someone curious about machine learning, I'd love to connect:

## A Note on This Website

You might notice some "under development" notices around the site. I'm continuously updating and improving this space, so please bear with me as I add more content and features. Think of it as a living document of my journey!

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something interesting here. Stay tuned for more updates on my research adventures and technical explorations!
