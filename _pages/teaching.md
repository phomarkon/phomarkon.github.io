I will be serving as a Teaching Assistant for an AI course under the supervision of [Associate Professor Serkan Ayvaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ihaclQQAAAAJ&hl=en). This role will involve:

- Supporting AI course instruction and student guidance
- Assisting with course materials and student assessments
