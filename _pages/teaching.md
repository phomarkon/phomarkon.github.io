## Teaching Experience

### Teaching Assistant - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
**Syddansk Universitet - University of Southern Denmark**  
*February 2026 - June 2026*

I will be a Teaching Assistant for the bachelor's course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence," supervised by [Associate Professor Serkan Ayvaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ihaclQQAAAAJ&hl=en).

My main responsibility will be to help students translate theory into practice during the weekly exercise sessions. My work will involve:

-   Developing and preparing hands-on exercises based on the course's core topics.
-   Leading the exercise sessions, guiding students as they work through problems and debug their code.
-   Assisting students in implementing key algorithms in Python, helping to solidify their understanding of the material.
-   Providing support on the machine learning component of the course, ensuring students can apply the concepts discussed in lectures.

#### Course Content Overview
The course provides a broad introduction to the foundational concepts of AI, including:
-   **Foundations of AI:** History, philosophy, and ethics.
-   **Problem-Solving with Search:** Uninformed and informed strategies, heuristics, and adversarial search for games.
-   **Knowledge & Reasoning:** Using propositional and first-order logic for knowledge representation and inference.
-   **Classical Planning:** Automated planning techniques.
-   **Machine Learning:** An introduction to supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

I look forward to the practical nature of this role. I believe that working through problems and helping others with their code is one of the best ways to gain a deep, intuitive grasp of foundational concepts. This experience will be an important part of my own academic journey.
