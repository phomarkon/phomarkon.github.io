**TLDR:** Nothing very special here, just a normal guy who likes deep learning.

**Longer Version:**

My path to research has been anything but direct. I moved from Thailand to Germany as a kid, spent four years in the [Deutsche Marine (German Navy)](https://www.bundeswehr.de/en/organization/navy), and later co-founded two startups after coming to Denmark. What those experiences taught me is that my real drive isn't building a business, but understanding how things learn and think. The questions that matter to me are academic ones.

So now, I'm a software engineering undergraduate at the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en), working as a research assistant in the [Data and Intelligence Lab](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/cis/laboratories/data-and-intelligence-lab) at the Centre for Industrial Software (CIS). My work is supervised by [Associate Professor Serkan Ayvaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ihaclQQAAAAJ&hl=en), who provides invaluable mentorship; he not only assigns me projects but also actively helps me to chase, discuss, and develop my own research ideas.

I'm trying to absorb as much as I can across the field before a PhD. I'm interested in almost everything, but I can feel a definite pull. I'm drifting away from straightforward computer vision and more towards the cognitive and philosophical foundations of our work. My interest in psychology and neuroscience keeps leading me back to questions of thinking, reasoning, and what it even means for a model to be trustworthy.

The idea that really grips me is the internal life of these models. The concept of 'model dreaming' - of a model learning from its own internally generated reality, feels important (and interesting and fun). I suspect the next breakthroughs won't just come from more data or bigger models, but from getting closer to these foundational principles of cognition. That's the territory I want to spend my career exploring, starting with a PhD.
