Nothing very special here, just a normal guy who likes deep learning.

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Syddansk Universitet - University of Southern Denmark, participating in machine learning research projects in the data and intelligence lab. I'm passionate about building machine learning pipelines, writing research papers, and exploring the fascinating intersection between research and entrepreneurship.

My path to academia isn't exactly a straight line - after moving from Thailand to Germany at 13, I served in the German Navy for four years, then moved to Denmark for my studies and co-founded two startups. I discovered my real passion isn't in business, but in academic research. I've been fortunate to work with Associate Professor Serkan Ayvaz, who has given me the freedom to formulate my own research ideas. I'm first author on several projects, including a paper accepted at KES 2025.

I'm currently trying to dip into different domains in machine learning and AI to broaden my understanding, but I have a feeling that my real interest will be in trustworthy and explainable AI. My fascination with psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience is pulling me from computer vision toward the cognitive side of AI. I'm particularly interested in concepts like 'model dreaming' and how models might learn from their own internally generated realities. My long-term goal is to pursue a PhD and build a career as an ML researcher, focusing on these foundational challenges in AI.
