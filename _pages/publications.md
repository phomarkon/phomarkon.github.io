**Research Interests:**
My research interests are intentionally broad as I explore diverse areas before pursuing a PhD:
- **Computer Vision**: Deep learning architectures, few-shot learning, foundation models
- **Medical Imaging**: Histological analysis, clinical AI applications, data-scarce scenarios
- **Remote Sensing & Earth Observation**: Satellite imagery analysis, flood detection, SAR anomaly detection
- **Traditional Machine Learning**: Classical approaches, ensemble methods, interpretable models
- **Multimodal AI**: Vision-language models, foundation models for specialized domains
- **Trustworthy AI**: Model reliability, robustness, ethical AI deployment
- **Explainable AI**: Model interpretability, XAI components, transparent decision-making
- **Large Language Models**: LLM applications, multimodal integration, foundation model capabilities
