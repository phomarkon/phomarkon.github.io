## Acknowledgments

In this section, I want to thank the people who have been instrumental in my academic and professional journey:

### Associate Professor Serkan Ayvaz

My research supervisor and mentor in the Data and Intelligence Lab. Serkan has given me the freedom to formulate my own research ideas and has been incredibly supportive throughout my journey from self-taught ML enthusiast to published researcher. His guidance has been invaluable in helping me discover my passion for academic research and develop my research skills.

### Toygar Tanyel
**Collaborator and Mentor**

A key collaborator who has contributed significantly to my understanding of machine learning and research methodologies. Toygar's insights and support have been crucial in my development as a researcher and in achieving the milestones I've reached so far.
